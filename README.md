# Stroop Effect Demonstration

## Overview
This web application demonstrates the Stroop effect, a psychological phenomenon where it is harder to say the color of a word if it spells out a different color. The application presents users with words written in colored ink, and the task is to select the color of the ink, not the word itself.

## Features
- Simple and intuitive interface
- Randomly generated word-color combinations to ensure variety
- Timer to track how quickly users can complete the task
- Score tracking to measure performance over multiple attempts

## How to Use
1. Open the web application in a modern web browser.
2. Click the "Start" button to begin the Stroop effect demonstration.
3. For each word presented, select the color of the ink used to write the word, not the word itself.
4. Repeat until the timer runs out or until you complete the specified number of rounds.
5. View your score and time taken to complete the task.

## Technologies Used
- React.js library
- CSS

## Credits
This application was created by me hh. It is inspired by the classic Stroop effect experiment in psychology.
